# LoopringNftToPinataUploadAutomater
This console app will help automate the process of uploading multiple NFT images/metadata to Pinata for Loopring NFT mints

Set some environmental variables, point it to a folder with your NFT Images, modify a couple of variables in the application, run it, then it will generate a csv for you with all of your Metadata CIDs!

You'll need Visual Studio 2022 with .NET 6 to build this.
